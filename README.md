## **The Idea**


Have you ever found it challenging to split a large grocery bill with your roommates or family? I understand the headache and time it takes to divide a bill that huge among several people. That's why I developed a full-stack application that simplifies the process of splitting large bills.

Introducing Splitify,

A full-stack web application for managing expense splits among friends. This application allows to calculate the split of each person involved in a huge bill (such as a grocery bill) in a quick and seamless process.

## Overview

Splitify is an intuitive application that eliminates the need for manual calculations and complicated spreadsheets. To use the app, simply sign in to your Splitwise account (using OAuth2), and add the name of the bill and its participants. Using the Splitwise API, you can select participants directly from your Splitwise friends list. From there, you can easily add items and select the participants for each split. With the ability to push the bill directly to Splitwise from the app, you'll save even more time and energy.

I designed Splitify to ensure a seamless experience for users. My goal was to create an application that makes splitting large bills, like grocery bills, a stress-free and enjoyable experience.

## Features

- Seamless choose the participants of the bill from your Splitwise friends list.
- Add/Delete items when adding the bill. Choose the participants involved in the purchase of an item.
- Bill generation will show a breakup of the entire bill and splits of every person involved in the bill.
- Using Splitwise APIs, you can directly push your bill to Splitwise right from Splitify.
- Breakup of the entire bill will be written to the comments of the bill.
